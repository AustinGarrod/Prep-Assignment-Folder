# Prep-Assignment-Folder

A console application that can handle a directory of zip files provided by the Desire2Learn system when multiple submissions are downloaded at once. Only the most recent submission by each student is kept, and the submissions are unziped into a folder named after the student.

This only works with a folder of zips, and is not a great solution but was built to solve a very specific time-sink for me. I figured that I should make it public so anyone else dealing with the same grading situation can have some help.
